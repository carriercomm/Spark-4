Version 0.0.3 (2010-05-13)
==========================
Ask the user where to save the file before starting a transfer
Show file type icons in the transfer list, instead of a generic icon
Implemented the 'Open received file' feature
Fixed the bug which prevented to start transfers if the default encoding was not UTF8
Icons are now properly looked up (Windows)
Fixed the bug where TcpReceiver prevented the process to exit (Windows)
