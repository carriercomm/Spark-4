Description: simple, multi-platform file-transfer tool
 Spark is a multi-platform file-transfer tool written in Python. It is intended 
 to be a simple way for people to share files without the drawbacks of email 
 (file size limit), IM software (no resume support) and file servers 
 (configuration, always-running daemon). 
 .
 More advanced features are planned, like using SSH for secure transfers or a 
 minimalistic, ephemeral web server for sending files to people who don't have 
 Spark.
